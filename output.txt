[32;1m[1;3m To create a comprehensive financial report for CK Hutchison Holdings Limited (stock id '0001.HK') using the provided financial information, I will calculate and discuss the following metrics: profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, solvency ratios, efficiency ratios, growth metrics, and valuation metrics.

Thought: Calculate and interpret Profitability Ratios
---------------------------------------------------

Profitability ratios demonstrate how efficiently a company generates profits with its assets, equity, and sales. The main profitability ratios are as follows:

1. **Return on Assets (ROA):** ROA is the net income divided by total assets. It measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate earnings. With an ROA of -18.13%, 0001.HK's profitability is significantly low, indicating poor asset management and/or performance.
2. **Return on Equity (ROE):** ROE is the net income divided by shareholder equity. It measures how effectively a company uses its shareholders' investments to generate returns. With an ROE of -18.13%, 0001.HK fails to provide positive returns to its investors, which is concerning for potential and current shareholders.

Thought: Calculate and interpret Liquidity Ratios
-----------------------------------------------

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to pay off short-term debts as they come due. The main liquidity ratios are as follows:

1. **Current Ratio:** Current ratio is the current assets divided by current liabilities. It measures whether a company can pay its short-term debts with its current assets. Based on the information provided, we cannot directly calculate the current ratio for 0001.HK. However, considering that the ROI and ROE are negative, it is likely that the current ratio would be lower than desired (below 1).
2. **Quick Ratio:** Quick ratio is similar to the current ratio, but instead of using all current assets, it only considers liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities). The quick ratio for 0001.HK cannot be calculated directly from the provided information. Nevertheless, considering the negative ROI and ROE, a low quick ratio is expected.

Thought: Calculate and interpret Solvency Ratios
-----------------------------------------------

Solvency ratios, also known as debt ratios, indicate a company's ability to meet its long-term debts. The main solvency ratios are as follows:

1. **Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E):** D/E is total liabilities divided by shareholder equity. It measures the proportion of assets funded by debt versus equity. Based on the information provided, we cannot calculate the D/E ratio directly for 0001.HK; however, it could be higher than desired due to the negative ROI and ROE.
2. **Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR):** ICR is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by interest expense. It measures a company's ability to pay interest on its debt. We cannot calculate the ICR for 0001.HK directly, but it may be lower than recommended due to the negative ROI and ROE.

Thought: Calculate and interpret Efficiency Ratios
-------------------------------------------------

Efficiency ratios measure how well a company manages its assets and liabilities in day-to-day operations. The most common efficiency ratios are as follows:

1. **Asset Turnover Ratio (ATR):** ATR is total sales divided by total assets. It shows how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales. We cannot calculate the ATR for 0001.HK directly from the provided information, but considering the low profitability metrics, it may be lower than desired.
2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR):** ITR is cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by average inventory. It measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory levels and turnover. We cannot calculate the ITR for 0001.HK directly, but considering the poor profitability metrics, it might be lower than optimal.

Thought: Calculate and interpret Growth Metrics
----------------------------------------------

Growth metrics provide insight into a company's past and potential future growth performance. The primary growth metric is as follows:

1. **Revenue Growth:** We do not have direct access to the revenue growth rate for 0001.HK from the provided information. However, considering the low ROI, ROE, and PE ratio (6.14), it can be inferred that revenue growth has been slow or negative recently.

Thought: Calculate and interpret Valuation Metrics
-----------------------------------------------

Valuation metrics assess whether a company's stock price is over- or underpriced compared to its financial performance. The main valuation metric for 0001.HK has already been provided:

1. **Price/Earnings (PE) Ratio:** The PE ratio of 6.14 suggests that 0001.HK is undervalued or slow-growing, which may indicate a buying opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the low valuation despite the high risk and poor profitability metrics.

**Final Answer:**

Financial Analysis of 0001.HK
==============================

Using the provided financial information, we have calculated and interpreted various financial ratios for CK Hutchison Holdings Limited (stock id '0001.HK'):

* **Profitability Ratios:** The Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are both negative at -18.13%, indicating poor profitability and inefficient use of assets and shareholder investments.
* **Liquidity Ratios:** We cannot directly calculate the current ratio or quick ratio due to missing information, but considering the negative ROI and ROE, they are likely lower than desired (below 1).
* **Solvency Ratios:** The Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E) and Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) cannot be directly calculated; however, they may be higher or lower than recommended due to the negative ROI and ROE.
* **Efficiency Ratios:** We cannot directly calculate the Asset Turnover Ratio (ATR) or Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR) due to missing information, but considering the poor profitability metrics, they may be lower than desired.
* **Growth Metrics:** Revenue growth cannot be calculated directly from the provided information, but it can be inferred that revenue growth has been slow or negative recently.
* **Valuation Metrics:** The Price/Earnings (PE) ratio of 6.14 indicates that 0001.HK is undervalued or slow-growing. This may present a buying opportunity for investors willing to accept high risk in exchange for potential returns.

In conclusion, 0001.HK has displayed poor profitability and negative ROI and ROE, which indicate that the company is currently struggling to generate profits and manage its assets effectively. The company's liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and revenue growth metrics are also uncertain due to missing information. However, given the low PE ratio, investors may find value in purchasing 0001.HK at its current valuation as a long-term investment opportunity if they believe that the company can improve its financial performance over time.[0m
