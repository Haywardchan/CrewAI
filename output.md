The correlation to HSI (Hang Seng Index) is 1.00, meaning that the index's price movements are perfectly positively correlated with the overall market. This indicates that the HSI index moves in tandem with the overall market and does not provide any diversification benefits.

The HSI index has a P/E Ratio of 0.00, which is not meaningful as it is typically calculated based on earnings per share (EPS) and the current market price of the stock. The variance of the stock is -2.71, which is negative due to the calculation method used in the database, but should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the financial performance of the HSI index is poor, with negative ROI and Sharpe Ratio.
