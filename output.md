After attempting to use various tools and manually visiting websites, I was unable to find the profitability ratios of 0001.HK. The errors I encountered while using the tools suggest that there may be issues with the tool configurations or the input data. For example, when using the "Search in a specific website" tool, an error occurred due to a missing positional argument 'search\_query'. Similarly, when using the "Database Search for particular stock" and "Database Search for all stocks" tools, unexpected keyword arguments were encountered. These errors indicate potential issues with the tools themselves or how they are being used.
Despite these challenges, I would recommend continuing to explore different methods and tools to find the required information. This might include double-checking the tool configurations, ensuring accurate input data, or seeking alternative resources for obtaining financial data on 0001.HK.
