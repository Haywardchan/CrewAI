Interpretation: The stock for CK Hutchison Holdings Limited (0001.HK) has a relatively high risk level of 20.92, which suggests that investing in this stock may be subject to significant price fluctuations. The negative ROI of -18.13 implies that the company's investment performance has been poor and shareholders have experienced losses. Moreover, the Sharpe ratio is negative (-0.87), indicating a low-risk adjusted return, which is not desirable for investors.
However, the stock shows a moderate correlation (0.75) with HSI, suggesting that its price movements are somewhat aligned with the broader Hong Kong market. This could be beneficial for diversification purposes in a portfolio context. The PE ratio of 6.14 implies that the stock may be undervalued compared to its earnings, which can be an opportunity for value investors. Lastly, the variance (2.20) indicates moderate volatility in the stock's returns.
In conclusion, while 0001.HK has a high risk level and poor recent performance, it presents some positive aspects such as its correlation to HSI and potentially undervalued PE ratio. Investors should weigh these factors carefully when considering an investment in this stock.
